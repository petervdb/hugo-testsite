# hugo-testsite
Small static website. You need Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) on your system to generate the static pages.
This repo contains all the files to generate the test website. 
Nothing much to be seen here. This is more for testing purposes and get familiar with the markup language for generating static website with Hugo.

For more information on Hugo, please visit https://gohugo.io/documentation/
